class_name ModLoaderHookChain
extends RefCounted
## Small class to keep the state of hook execution chains and move between mod hook calls.[br]
## For examples, see [method ModLoaderMod.add_hook].


## The reference object is usually the [Node] that the vanilla script is attached to. [br]
## If the hooked method is [code]static[/code], it will contain the [GDScript] itself.

func _init(reference_object: Object, callbacks: Array) -> void:

	_callback_index = callbacks.size()


## Will execute the next mod hook callable or vanilla method and return the result.[br]
## Make sure to call this method [i][color=orange]once[/color][/i] somewhere in the [param mod_callable] you pass to [method ModLoaderMod.add_hook]. [br]

## [br][b]Parameters:[/b][br]
## - [param args] ([Array]): An array of all arguments passed into the vanilla function. [br]
